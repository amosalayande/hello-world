# hello-world
Glad to try this out for the first time. yaaaay!!!
Should I call this my 2nd attempt at coding as I have started work with HTML and CSS. 
I see what you're about to say, it is not coding, HTML is only a mark up language. 
I am glad to have taken the CS50 course, starting with CS50T, exposing me to the world of computing.
